First of all, I don't want to get too technical about the start and end of decades.
Personally, I would prefer the decade to had ended in 2019; yet I think 2020/12/31 will be the end of the current decade.

Anyway, since I already explained that the title is technically incorrect - what else can we expect from this article?

More or less the article is a personal one, I want to reflect on what happened last year and compare it with what I expected before.
Luckily, I wrote a similar article at the beginning of last year [Year++ - A Software Engineer’s New Year’s Resolutions](../_site/year-a-software-engineers-new-years-resolutions). 

The second part of the article is about the things I intend to do this year. Let's see how all of this ends.

## 2019s resolutions

My last year's resolutions were:
* Writing 50 blog posts
* Learn Android (Kotlin)
* Improve the Stability of the Backend I was working on
* Extend my Knowledge of Backend Technologies

Ok, let's check if I did even achieve anything of these.

**Writing 50 blog posts**: The resolution I actually remembered and already knew before checking that I would be missing a few posts.
I wrote **24** blog posts last year. I knew I would be short - but I am still quite satisfied with the actual count.

Writing those posts was more work than I initially expected. I have to stay at it in order to reach a similar count next year.

**Learn Android (Kotlin)**

In a conversation, this would be when you try to avoid eye-contact. Obviously, I didn't put too much pressure on this. In the first quarter of the year, I learned the Android Basics using Java in my spare time. Since then I didn't use any of that knowledge. 

When it comes to Kotlin it looks a bit better. At work, we had a 3-month exploration. The Backend was a Kotlin Spring Boot service.
For the current product I am working on, Kotlin is used for several services.

**Improve the Stability of the Backend**

I would count this a success: Despite leaving my old project earlier than expected, I still could use the time I had to improve the stability together with my colleagues. My latest tasks were the foundation for further improvements.

**Extend my Knowledge of Backend Technologies**
Looking back, this worked pretty well. Joining the new product allowed me to get in contact with technologies that were new to me.
To name a few: Keycloak, Postgres, Kubernetes, Azure.

### Recap of 2019s resolutions
I didn't reach all my goals. But what did I do instead?

With the new product, there were new personal challenges.

A big part of the initial effort was to migrate the existing project to a new team. I also was the first developer of that new team. 

One of my occupations was to staff the new team. I didn't have the freedom that I was expecting still, I am more than satisfied with the final outcome. I think we have a really good team that can throw at all problems that come along.
Even after the team staffing was completed, I participated in a lot of interviews for future candidates.

Instead of learning Android, I had a good refresh on the basics of [React](https://reactjs.org/), one of the most popular JavaScript Web Frameworks. I expect that I can further deepen that knowledge during the next year.

So much for 2019 - what will 2020 have in store for me?

## New Year Resolutions for 2020

I enjoy writing for Programmerfriend.com, I definitely want to keep it going. I don't want to commit to a number here, but I realized I need to create a schedule for writing blog posts. Let's commit to writing at least **the same amount of posts as in the previous year**.

When giving advice to others, I always stress to get out of the comfort zone. I also want to do this to myself and therefore will try to **get into some kind of public speaking**. I'm not yet settled on the way I want to tackle this in detail, but we will see.

Still out of my comfort zone: I want to start my own things. Programmerfriend is really awesome, but I think it could be the time to **start something on my own, a side-hustle to my daily 9 to 5**. I still don't have any clue but I am pretty sure I will come up with something during the next few months.

Lately, I realized that my typing became a bit bad. I measured it and it seems that I max out at around 70 words per minute. It is not only the speed but I would love to switch back to using more than 4 to 6 fingers for it. If it is not for the speed, I would love to do it for ergonomics and convenience. This year I want to go back to **Touch typing** with higher accuracy.

When it comes to my current work, I am pretty satisfied with how everything works out right now. Things I would like to improve are:
* **Meeting efficiency**: Replace meetings by e-mails when possible.
* **Continue to work on the project/team**: Instead of just writing code, I got a lot of tasks that require me to go beyond that.
I am a technical person but I am not just someone who writes code. I love to improve the whole Development process where possible.
No matter if it is about Testing, CI/CD or talking to product owners or architects when thinking about the next features we want to implement.
* **Network at Work**: I still have the feeling that at work I have a limited view over all the aspects. Therefore I would like to reach out to colleagues who are working on other projects in my business unit.
* **Help where Help is needed/wanted**: In my opinion, the company as such or at least the business unit is facing a rough time. I would really like to help outside of my current scope where possible. Let's see if I get the opportunity to do so.

## Recap

We talked a lot about the past, today and the near future.
This article focused on me, but how about you?

Personally, I am always on the hunt for good programming books. Books are an opinionated topic, therefore I am quite sure some people would disagree with this selection. Nonetheless let's have a look at my opinionated selection of the best Java books to read in 2019.

You might realize that a lot of books here are not Java-specific at all, still they are the ones I would highly recommend to any Java Developer.

## Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=2LPDEFFWLY2B1&keywords=clean+code&qid=1564266758&s=gateway&sprefix=clean+code,aps,240&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=7be7691c9b83868b2f8f1be8077d62c2" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0132350882&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=0132350882" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Let's start with the book that influenced my day to day work the most: [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software]. 

For many it is more than a book. It is a movement, a cult.
Ok back to being serious: It is a book about Coding Principles with valuable knowledge extracted from years of experience.

Since I read that one early in my career it was eye-opening and immensely improved my way of writing and thinking about code.
This is one of the books for which I would recommend to keep it around. It doesn't hurt to reread it from time to time.

## The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master by Andrew Hunt & David Thomas
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=ecf1a3630cdf92abb00d52c775182ecf" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0135957052&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=0135957052" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Also an early read for me. It is a book I thoroughly enjoyed.

Both authors succeeded in creating good analogies for most of there concepts.
As a result, [The Pramatic Programmer] is a breeze to read and makes remembering the concepts based on analogies really easy. 

In comparison to *Clean Code* it is less about code but more about principles and the Programming as a craft.

## Effective Java by Joshua Bloch
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=effective+java&qid=1564268102&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=fa178caa9d564699c795bdf481d1a8a6" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0134685997&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=0134685997" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Hey, finally a Java Book on this "Best Java Books list". Actually I think it is **THE BOOK** every Java developer should read and have around.

[Effective Java] is in my eyes also an evergreen book. With the release of the 3rd edition it was updated for Java 7, 8 and 9.
Here we have another book which I would definitely recommend to buy. For me it is not a "read once" book. From time to time I pick it up at work to look up a few things here and there.

It is also a good source for finding arguments in Code Reviews ðŸ˜Š.

## Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code by Martin Fowler
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=XOJKIJC415RY&keywords=improving+the+design+of+existing+code&qid=1564267774&s=books&sprefix=improving+the+design+of,stripbooks-intl-ship,220&sr=1-2&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=2442a24d705703a964067da9b08c53f9" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0201485672&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=0201485672" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

A book I only recently lend from a co-worker.
What I liked about [Refactoring]: It is easy to follow and teaches you the process and mechanics involved in refactoring code.

Fowler teaches a lot about different refactoring technologies and has a lot of examples on how to use them.
Also he stresses writing Tests, since they are the safety net for all the executed refactorings.

**Just make sure that you get the book you want - the [second edition of Refactoring] is using JavaScript as the language of choice.
The [first Edition of Refactoring] includes the examples in Java.**

I personally only read the first edition, so I can not speak directly for the second.

## Java Concurrency in Practice by Brian Goetz
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=2TVDA46CJYAK1&keywords=java+concurrency+in+practice&qid=1564268122&s=gateway&sprefix=java+concu,aps,221&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=ef57b2769d3057e94b5b576ba993bfac" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0321349601&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=0321349601" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Dealing with concurrency is not as easy as one might think. [Java Concurrency in Practice] presents a lot of pitfalls and how to deal with them.
It is not an easy read, but I think this is due to concurrency not being an easy topic.

Sadly it is a bit dated and based on Java 6, a lot of the new constructs could also use an explaination similar to the ones mentioned in the book.
For all the things covered it is still spot-on.

## Test Driven: TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Acceptance-Java-Developers/dp/1932394850/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=251S9KZSEGDE6&keywords=test+driven+tdd+and+acceptance+tdd+for+java+developers&qid=1564267991&s=gateway&sprefix=Test+driven+tdd+an,aps,228&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=8f489cead19cb19a9aaabd7bce856431" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1932394850&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=1932394850" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I am a big fan of Test Driven Development. Therefore it is really a no-brainer to put [Test Driven] on this list.

Lasse Koskela managed to make a not so popular topic, pretty bearable. The book is not perfect, still it sold TDD to me.
It comes with all the techniques and tools you need for successfully writing your code in a test driven manner.

I would recommend it to the more experienced Java Developers.

## Head First Design Patterns
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=3A0OHG6A5V30U&keywords=head+first+design+patterns&qid=1564268033&s=gateway&sprefix=head+first+design,aps,231&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=6a3a98a059b5585e165ad8d10b59e7ec" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0596007124&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=0596007124" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

If you ever had to force your way through any Design Patterns book and you couldn't keep reading it - this book is for you!

[Head First Design Patterns] is an easy to read book. It is by a mile not a reference book, but it is a book which helps you to learn a few  Design Patterns AND remember them. I really appreciate how [Head First Design Patterns] made learning about Design Patterns actually fun.

## Head First Java
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Java-Kathy-Sierra/dp/0596009208/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=head+first+java&qid=1564268049&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=54511ab33ab1d95a7d5ec5b84d70c9f3" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0596009208&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=0596009208" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

This is not a book every Java Developers needs to own. If you come from any other programming language it is definitely optional.
[Head First Java] is a one of the best books for people trying to learn programming and java being their first programming language.

Similar to [Head First Design Patterns], [Head First Java] is written in an engaging way and makes sure that you don't want to put it away.
After finishing it, one should be good switching to any other Java learning resource.

## Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software by Michael Nygard
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=release+it&qid=1564267708&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=f23dc496726ca634aeacfefc873e7e00" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1680502395&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=1680502395" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

As of writing this, I did not complete it yet. The reason I had to buy it was that I heard about it on two conference talks back to back.

What I liked already after skimming over it was that it covers a lot of real-world issues with software in production.
The title is really underselling it - think I will still have some fun and learn a lot about hard won lessons.

I think [Release It!] is a book you can recommend to just anybody wanting to write production-ready applications.

## Kotlin in Action
<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kotlin-Action-Dmitry-Jemerov/dp/1617293296/ref=as_li_ss_il?crid=2YP10DSDW8P6N&keywords=kotlin+in+action&qid=1564268017&s=gateway&sprefix=kotlin+in+ac,aps,231&sr=8-1&linkCode=li3&tag=prgfrd-20&linkId=bbc9a0959a1f323c239e0b8cfb293c08" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1617293296&Format=_SL500_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=prgfrd-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=prgfrd-20&l=li3&o=1&a=1617293296" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
2017

Whoa! This is not a Java Book. Yes that's right.

A few months back, we started a new project with Kotlin instead of Java. Mostly we did this because we only heard good things from our Android Developers about it. All the involved developers enjoyed it after a while.

Kotlin is a programming language also running on the JVM. And it is perfectly compatible with Java.

In fact, the interoperability with Java is so good that you can really mix it in your code.
If you like Java, I am pretty sure you could get used to Kotlin and love it.

[Kotlin in Action] is a good match for Java Developers wanting to learn Kotlin. Also the official documentation is great!

Having a look at my LinkedIn Network, I realized there are a few ways of growing your Software Engineering Career. I am trying to keep my personal opinion out of the middle part and only get involved in the end of the article.

### Working for a Single Company

There are plenty of people who only have worked for a single company. Maybe my network is a bit biased, since it contains a lot of people who not have finished their first 5 years.

Most of them stayed in the same role or added/removed a prefix from their title (e.g. Senior, Junior). A few who have worked for almost 10 years, have been promoted to a management role.

### Switching Company shortly after a Promotion

Another pattern I often see: Switching companies shortly after getting promoted.

My interpretation here is that the title was following what the person was already doing for a while.
When the person gets promoted, nothing changes but the leverage to go for a higher pay somewhere else.

### Moving between Teams until getting promoted

This seems to be a thing in big corporations. A person switches a lot between projects until he takes over a management role for a whole team.
In my networks there are a few people doing that but not yet having received their promotion. Let's see if people get stuck while doing this.

### Switching Companies every 4 to 9 months

It is often referred as *"Patchwork Career"*.

People with such careers have a very broad experience with a lot of industries and technologies.
This behaviour seems to be not affecting promotions negatively. People in my network have interesting positions even after switching really often.

### Being a Contractor

People working as contractors are a mix of all of the just mentioned patterns.
I know a few people who worked across teams, across companies and even across industries.
Contract terms seem to be between 3 months and 3 years.

## My Opinion on jumping Ship

Sorry for saying it, there is no silver-bullet.

At least for myself I didn't yet find one.

I am currently 3 years at my current employer (a 1400 person company) and have received a small promotion a year ago. Currently I am watching people who started together with me to move to other companies to further advance their careers.

### The Benefits I see in leaving:

**Easier to get a regular increase in your Paycheck:**<br>
  When you are switching jobs, you have an opportunity to talk about your Paycheck. In this situations it is much easier to get the salary bump you are chasing.

**Seeing alternatives:**<br>
  When working in a single team for a while you are getting used to the way things are done. Switching companies can easily give you a refreshing view on *"how things could done differently"*. After a while, you have a good experience about what kind of benefits and cons some decisions might have.

**Experiencing more of the industry:**<br>
  Similar to the previous point, you see different industries and how things are done there. Your current big enterprise could benefit from your previous startup-experience (or the other way around).

I would really like to hear about your opinion on this topic!

**Do you think jumping ship is improving your career or is it worth to stay a while?**<br>

This might sound really controversial, but I think there should be times were developers should be free to do whatever they want.

To make it even more controversial, I think it is beneficial when this time is not during their leisure time but on company time.

> Why should I pay my developers to do whatever they want?<br>

# Developers

I think it is generally acknowledged that developers need to stay up-to-date to be successful.
For their career growth, they need to regularly sharpen their saw.

If they don't learn new things here and there, they could be in a bad position when they need to look for a new job down the road.

It could also be bad for your business: You want to have developers that are able to pick up new technologies and deliver solutions required in the future.  

This chase for new technology might be not aligned with your business needs:

> My developers should work on their current projects and create value/billable hours!<br>
> \- A Boss the CEO loves

A lot of times, you want to use battle-proofed technologies for solving tasks that are crucial for your business.
There are a lot of examples of this all across the industry.

Facebook started with plain PHP and MySQL. Airbnb is powered by a Rails monolith that talks to multiple Java Applications.
Dropbox uses Python and MySQL. Youtube is mainly powered by Python, Apache, and MySQL.

See? You wouldn't be in bad company ðŸ˜‰ (references: [Stackshare.io](http://stackshare.io/) / [Youtube Techstack 2012](http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/3/26/7-years-of-youtube-scalability-lessons-in-30-minutes.html)). 

**So, where exactly is the problem?**

As you have seen, there is a conflict. It might be the best interest of a business to run with more mature technologies. In contrast, some Developers could be really interested in adding more and more technologies to their CVs. Stuff like this could even make them switch jobs.

# The problem

Hopefully, you are not micromanaging your developers, aren't you?

When developers have a lot of freedom in their daily routine (which is a good thing - because it allows them to choose the right tool for the job), they might tend to choose the new shiny technology just because they want to try it out.

A few weeks later, you have that bleeding-edge technology on production.
It could work out really great or you could run into problems down the road, who knows?

My thesis is that not giving developers room to try out these things in a non-productive environment, will drive them towards doing it on production. This might not be true for all developers - Some *just* switch jobs. 

Wouldn't it be better if developers could have that experience with a non-productive system?

# A few possible solutions

Why don't you give your developers (or employees in general) a day each or every second week to work on their own ideas?

Employees could be free to either brush up their skills by working on tutorials or alternatively building tools that help in their daily work.

Another option could be that you instruct some of your developers to organize a regular hackathon (monthly/bi-monthly/whatever) during office hours.

# The benefits
I guarantee there are a lot of benefits with this approach, let's name a few:
* Developers have an environment where they can try out things
* Developers gain a broader view of technology
* Cool tools that would not get priority over "daily business" will get created
* An employee could come up with a new product idea
* Higher employee happiness = better retention
* In my opinion, it is beneficial for the "engineering culture"
* Create opportunity for socializing between employees

# The cons
Let's make it not only one-sided:

Of course, it gonna cost money, developers will be working less on projects that create direct money.
Still, you could argue that motivated people probably create more in 72 than 80 hours.

But this is actually more or less the only downside I see here.

# Recap

We have seen why not giving developers room for experimenting and learning new things is potentially dangerous.
Long-term, they could either quit or get detached from their daily work, both things you want to avoid.

Most developers will always chase new shiny things, why don't leverage that effect to let them create new cool tools or ideas that could really change your business for the better?

Why don't create an environment where your developers together learn new things on the job?

In my opinion it is a pretty *low-risk but high-reward* investment that you could stop after a year when you don't like it.

**Why don't give it a try?**

I think your developers and your employee retention might really thank you.
